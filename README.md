# Numerical-Competition
This repository includes my contributions to the MSHO (Multi-Stage Hybrid Optimizer), which is an entry for the [GNBG competition](https://competition-hub.github.io/GNBG-Competition/). It contains presentation slides, algorithm testing, and finally the complete MSHO algorithm. 
You can reference the official repository of our team [here](https://github.com/VNF-MSO/numericalGlobalOptimizationCompetition_GECCO2024).

# Run
Just run `src/MSHO.ipynb` in this repository, or run it online on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ihbkaiser/notebook2da87472e0).
# Materials
The related documents are placed in `materials`.  

# Result
Our algorithm ranked #1 in the GNBG Competition across 24 functions. Our results are placed in the `results` folder. Each .dat file represents the results of the corresponding function over 31 runs, where each line indicates the error compared to the actual optimum and the number of Function Evaluations (FEs) used
